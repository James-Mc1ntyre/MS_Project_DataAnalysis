<h2 align="center" > What is this? </h2>
<div> Data analysis for both fNIRS and EEG recorded from a virtual reality visuo-spatial memory paradigm. </div> 

<h2 align="center" > Experiment description </h2>
Participants were asked to comlete a VR task which involves visuo-spatial memory. They are asked to remember the orientation of an object ('Stimulus object') which appears briefly in front of them. Then, a rotated version of the same object appears ('Rotation object') and they are tasked with rotating the object to match the original orientation usign the VR controller.

<h2 align="center" > Usage </h2>
<div> The data and figures are all saved in the Data folder under each participants name and session date. Only two participants are included here, each with one recording session. </div> 
<div> Analysis.py is where the data is loaded, preprocessed, and visualized. The figures are already created and saved for each participant </div>
