<div> Data analysis for both fNIRS and EEG recorded from a virtual reality visuo-spatial memory paradigm. </div> 

<h2 align="center" > Experiment description </h2>
Participants were asked to comlete a VR task which involves visuo-spatial memory. They are asked to remember the orientation of an object ('Stimulus object') which appears briefly in front of them. Then, a rotated version of the same object appears ('Rotation object') and they are tasked with rotating the object to match the original orientation usign the VR controller. See the description below.
